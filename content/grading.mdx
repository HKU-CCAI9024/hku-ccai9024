# Grading

The course assessment is designed to evaluate both your technical understanding of generative AI and your ability to apply these tools creatively and critically.

## Grade Distribution

| Component | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Group Project** | 50% | Research or workflow development with presentation |
| **Assignments** | 30% | 7 individual assignments building creative portfolio |
| **Lecture Attendance** | 20% | Active participation in lectures and discussions |

## Detailed Assessment Criteria

---

## Group Project (50%)

The group project has three components: content quality, presentation delivery, and collaborative effort.

### Content Assessment

#### Option A: Industry Impact Research Essay

**Grade A (90-100%)**
- Consistent interviews covering main dissemination and impact of generative ai. 
- Consistent perceptive and critical engagement with issues and themes based on comprehensive understanding of generative ai. 
- The analysis, synthesis and application of knowledge is consistently clear and effective.


**Grade B (80-89%)**
- Generally completed interviews covering most of dissemination and impact of generative ai. 
- Frequent perceptive and critical engagement with issues and themes based on general understanding of generative ai. 
- The analysis, synthesis and application of knowledge is general clear and effective.


**Grade C (70-79%)**
- Barely completed interviews covering some dissemination and impact of generative ai. 
- Some perceptive and critical engagement with issues and themes of generative ai.
- The analysis, synthesis and application of knowledge is mostly clear and effective.


**Grade D (60-69%)**
- Insufficient number of required interviews covering a few of dissemination and impact of generative ai. 
- Occasional perceptive and critical engagement with issues and themes of generative ai but lacks depth. 
- The analysis, synthesis and application of knowledge rarely goes beyond reproduction of relevant concepts and theories.


**Grade F (Below 60%)**
- Fail to conduct interviews.
- No critical engagement with issues and themes. 
- Essay characterized by serious inaccuracies and misunderstandings of generative ai.

#### Option B: GenAI Workflow Design

**Grade A (90-100%)**
- Effective and executable generative ai workflow with novel functionalities. 
- Consistent tech implementation and clear design philosophy based on comprehensive understanding of generative ai.

**Grade B (80-89%)**
- Executable generative ai workflow with general completed functionalities. 
- Completed tech implementation and clear design philosophy based on general understanding of generative ai.

**Grade C (70-79%)**
- Executable generative ai workflow with unclear and ineffective functionality.
- Completed tech implementation and mostly clear design philosophy.

**Grade D (60-69%)**
- Inexecutable but complete generative ai workflow. 
- Completed tech implementation but unclear design philosophy.


**Grade F (Below 60%)**
- Fail to deliver complete generative ai workflow.
- Incomplete tech implementation.
- Fail to deliver any reasonable design philosophy.


### Presentation Assessment

**Grade A (90-100%)**
- The presentation provides an outline which clearly introduces the structure and a conclusion that clearly summarizes the main ideas/arguments. 
- Transitions from one main idea/argument to the next are always clear to the listener.

**Grade B (80-89%)**
- The presentation provides an outline which introduces the structure and a conclusion that summarizes the main ideas/ arguments but one or both could be more comprehensive. 
- The listener is always able to follow the development of the main arguments.

**Grade C (70-79%)**
- The presentation provides an outline which introduces the structure and/or a conclusion that summarizes the main ideas/ arguments. 
- However, one or both may be insufficiently clear and/or lacking in enough detail. 
- Transitions from one main idea/argument are mostly clear to the listener.

**Grade D (60-69%)**
- The presentation endeavours to provide an outline which introduces the structure of the presentation or a conclusion that summarizes the main ideas/ arguments, although one or both may be unclear and/or lack enough detail to be useful to the listener. 
- Transitions from one main idea/argument are occasionally clear to the listener.

**Grade F (Below 60%)**
- There is no outline or conclusion. 
- Transitions from one main idea/argument are unclear because of a lack of signaling. 
- The listener is not able to follow the development of any of the main arguments.

**Grade C (70-79%)**
- Complete and timely submission.
- Submitted content align with some required points.

**Grade D (60-69%)**
- Incomplete but timely submission.
- Submitted content rarely align with required points.


**Grade F (Below 60%)**
- No submission.

## Lecture Attendance (20%)

**Grade A (90-100%)**
- Participates actively and constructively all the time.

**Grade B (80-89%)**
- Participates actively most of the time.

**Grade C (70-79%)**
- Participates most of the time but sometimes requires prompting.
