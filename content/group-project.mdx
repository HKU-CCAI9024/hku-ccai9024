# Group Project

The group project is a collaborative effort that explores the real-world impact and applications of generative AI in creative industries.

## Project Overview

- **Weight:** 50% of final grade
- **Group Size:** 5-6 persons per group
- **Presentation Time:** 10 minutes-12 minutes per group
- **Presentation Dates:** Week 12 (Nov 22) & Week 13 (Nov 29), 2025

## Project Options

### Option A: Industry Impact Research
Conduct comprehensive interviews with creative industry professionals to analyze GenAI's dissemination and impact.

### Option B: GenAI Workflow Design
Design and implement an innovative workflow using generative AI techniques with novel functionalities.

---

## Option A: Industry Impact Research

### Overview
Interviewing at least three professionals in creative industries about the degree of dissemination and impact of generative ai to their fields. Writing an essay covering concise interview notes and own analysis, views and thoughts. 

---

## Option B: Novel GenAI Workflow Design

### Overview
Designing a workflow using generative ai techniques that has novel functionalities or effects. This workflow can be implemented but not limited to Huggingface and ComfyUI. A working demo is required. Writing a short tech report covering the design philosophy and potential benefits. 

## Grading & Individual Attribution

### Overall Split
**70% team grade + 30% individual adjustment**

### Team Grade (70%)
**Rubric (10 pts each; total 70):**
1. Problem clarity & relevance
2. Method/design soundness (A: interview protocol; B: workflow architecture)  
3. Execution quality (A: analysis; B: working demo & reliability)
4. Insight/novelty & impact
5. Documentation quality (essay/tech note)
6. Presentation (clarity, timing, Q&A)
7. Ethics & limitations

### Individual Adjustment (30%) via Contribution Factor
- At the end of the semester, each team member will rate each other, with a total score of 100. The maximum score that each person can get is 100*n
- **Evidence required** (kept in repo/docs): commit history, PRs/issues, meeting minutes, interview notes, analysis notebooks, slide edits. Lack of evidence → TA may cap CF at 1.0.

**Safeguards:**
- Trim the highest/lowest 10% of peer points if the team is conflicted.
- TA review for anomalies (e.g., one member rated extremely low/high by all).
- Academic integrity: all interviews and assets must be original and consented.

## Progress Updates & Checkpoints

### Fortnight Post (due Sun 23:59)
- **Group ID**
- **Group members** 
- **Past progress**
- **Next step**
- **Risks/blockers**
- **Demo/report links**

### Milestones
- **W3**: Team formation completed.
- **W5**: **Design/Methods Freeze** (A: interview guide + recruitment plan; B: system diagram + tech choices).
- **W7**: **Mid-check**
  - A: interviews scheduled + results(if has);
  - B: runnable skeleton (even if no-code) + failure-mode notes.
- **W10**: **Beta** (A: ≥60% interviews complete + initial coding; B: feature-complete demo + short tech note draft).
- **W11/12**: Final presentation + report/demo submission.


## Group Formation and Management

### Group Formation
- **Deadline:** To be announced by Group Project TAs
- **Size:** 5-6 members (no exceptions)

### Project Management
- **TA Support:** Lingrui Xu and Lin Li
- **Support:** Technical assistance and guidance throughout the project
